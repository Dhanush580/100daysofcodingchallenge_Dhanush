Day1 challenge done :)
as part of day 1 challengeI visited github.com and login into my github account which i created previously before joining into this challenge.
(you're used to create one if you don't have one as a part of challenge), and explored the platform and learnt some terminology such as repository, pull, push, pull request, branch, etc.
